## About

Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules. The user can use the search feature to find a specific recipe, save recipes to a bookmarks list via local storage, and even add their own custom recipes. Also, the user can easily increase or decrease servings and view detailed recipe directions.

## Built With

This app is built with pure vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and SCSS. It uses parcel as its module bundler and NPM as its package manager.
